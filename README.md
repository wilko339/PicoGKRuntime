This has been modified for use in PicoGH, a Grasshopper wrapper for PicoGK. 

# Welcome to PicoGK Runtime

PicoGK Runtime is the C++ backbone to [PicoGK](https://picogk.org) a compact, robust geometry kernel for [Computational Engineering](https://leap71.com/computationalengineering/). 

This repo is hosted at: https://github.com/leap71/PicoGKRuntime

You will usually not clone this directory, unless you want to compile the PicoGK Runtime yourself instead of [using the available installers.](https://github.com/leap71/PicoGK/releases)

PicoGK Runtime is based on the [OpenVDB](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openvdb) and [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw) open source projects.
